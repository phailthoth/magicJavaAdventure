Speaker: Player

Speaker: None
	[ You look around frantically, continually looking for them but can't. ]

Path 1 ( Force Magics ) :

// change background to a kitchen with main focus on a door

Speaker : Player
	Phew, I'm almost out of here.

Speaker : None
	[ Suddenly, a flaming pillar, one simlar to the one which had crushed your mom, falls in your way - blocking the door. ]

Speaker : Player
	DANG IT ! 

Speaker : None
	[ Out of rage, you punch the pillar. ]
	[ However, before your hand hits the pillar, a shimering light erupts from the space inbetween, and a circle suddenly emmits from the space as well. ]
	[ Suddenly, an immense force knocks the pillar, and everything behind it, foreward and leaves a whole in your house. ]
	[ You stand quietly in amazement, at your hand, before running out, leaving everything behind. ]


Path 2 ( Light Manipulation ) : 

// change background to a near black basement

Speaker: Player
	( sigh ) I wish it weren't so dark down here. 

Speaker: None
	[ Suddenly, you have an image of yourself holding your hands close together, channeling a ball of light between them. ]
	[ As your general impulsive self, you decide to do the same, despite the unrealisticness of it. ]
	[ Just as in the image of your head, you decide to bring your hands together, creating a sphere in the palms of your hand. ]
	[ As if by magic, a ball of light materalizes in your hand, whisping around. ]
	[ Using this light, you run out of the basement, through the underground escape, leaving your parents and your house behind. ]

Path 3 ( Elemental Manipulation ) :

Speaker: Player
	No! I'm not leaving you!

Speaker: None
	[ You shove your hand below the flaming wood beam. ]
	[ As you attempt to lift it off your mom's body, the fire begins to creep up your arms ]

Speaker: Mom
	No! [Player Name], I told you to leave me! Be a good child and leave me!

Speaker: None
	[ Fire continues to climb up your arm, and reaches towards your neck. ]
	[ You manage to uncover half of your mother's body ]
	[ You look down and stare at your mom's body. Burned, crushed. Your eyes move to her face, her eyes looking at your flaming arms, in complete fear. ]

Speaker: Mom
	Get away! Leave me already! Why can't you be a good child and leave me behind.

Speaker: Player
	No, I refuse to leave you behind! 

Speaker: None
	[ You stare down at your flame covered arms, and quickly bite down into the flames. ]
	[ After biting off a peice, you begin to eat the flames off of your arms, piece by piece until they're completely gone. ]
	[ You continue to lift off the pillar of wood off of your mother, until it's completely off her, and toss the pillar to the side. ]
	[ You look down, and your mom has fainted, her body unable to withstand anymore pain. ]
	[ You pick up your mother, and quickly take her out of the house from the front door, behind you. ]

Speaker: Player
	[ Sigh ] I need to find a place to get mom somewhere. Everyone is so far away!
	Why did we have to live in the middle of nowhere?

Speaker: None
	[ You slam your first against the rock next to you, but as you do, a flame bursts out from your fist and dissipates into the air around you. ]
	[ You spend a brief moment, staring at your hand amazed at what had happened. ]
	[ After that moment, you realize that your mother is still hurt, pick her up, and quickly take her to the nearest town for help. ]
